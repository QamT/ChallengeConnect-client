## The Idea

ChallengeConnect is an application that lets teams go head to head to complete a series of challenges. Players can get points by uploading proofs of completed challenges and the first team to do so for all challenges will win the game. Players with the highest score will appear on the leaderboard. Players can socialize with other players through the global chat and can even add each other to their friend's list.
